README for RWi  Version 0.15  89 Dec 4

    See RELEASE.NOT for the complete set of notes.

MAJOR ADDITIONS & CHANGES:

    Files that appear to be non-ascii are viewed in binary.  These
    are files containing nulls or long lines in the first 2K
    characters.

    File types (Ascii and Binary) are back, for setting default type
    for viewing.


KNOWN BUGS:

    The disk with files=50, es-41, 48tpi has problems.  It appears to
    have a damaged track 0, and it contains a LONG file that doesn't
    read properly.

    It only writes short-format files at the moment (no more than 8
    contiguous pieces.)  This is OK if the disk you are writing to is 
    initially empty.
