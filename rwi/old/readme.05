README for RWi  Version 0.05  89 Sep 18

    See RELEASE.NOT for the complete set of notes.

MAJOR ADDITIONS & CHANGES:

    This is a partial release; just the things I've changed since
    the last one.  Be sure to keep your changes to DISK.C, etc. until
    we figure out how to do things right.

    With any luck, we can now read HD disks on AT's.  I tried it this
    afternoon and it didn't work, but I had wrong stuff in the drive
    state word.  So we'll see.  

    Media type in the Drive menu will either go away or get changed
    to something more useful.

    RAW now puts 80 tracks on AT drives.

    I should now be putting the disk base back correctly.


KNOWN BUGS:

    Files bigger than 64K aren't viewed correctly.  Read, and hence
    copy, does work.  I'm in the process of fixing this; the code (in
    Viewer.c) is presently commented out.

    Doesn't write iRMX disks.
