README for RWi  Version 0.16  89 Dec 11

    See RELEASE.NOT for the complete set of notes.

MAJOR ADDITIONS & CHANGES:

    Some of the larger modules have been split up.  This is mainly in
    preparation for the eventual merge into RD7.  Among other things,
    code which is only used in RAW is now out of RWI (about 2.5Kb).

    When moving in the Directory view, the Files view is not updated
    if there are command characters still to be read.  This makes
    moving around in the directory tree MUCH faster.

    The Directory view now displays total number of files and total
    size for each directory.

    Reading a damaged disk no longer hangs.

KNOWN BUGS:

    Viewing a binary file in ascii mode may be very slow.

    It only writes short-format files at the moment (no more than 8
    contiguous pieces.)  This is OK if the disk you are writing to is 
    initially empty.
