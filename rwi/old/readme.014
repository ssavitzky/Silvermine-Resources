README for RWi  Version 0.14  89 Nov 28

    See RELEASE.NOT for the complete set of notes.

MAJOR ADDITIONS & CHANGES:

    Writing on iRMX disks works, but is probably flaky.

    Still more seek problems fixed.  This time, we're using a
    brute-force approach using the same algorithm used for reading. 
    This is more likely to be reliable.


KNOWN BUGS:

    The problems with errstr.fil are due to the fact that it contains
    almost no linefeeds.  View doesn't like enormously long lines.

    There are some crashes, possibly caused by switching densities or
    possibly by some oddity in format.  files=50, es-41, 48tpi hangs
    reliably.

    There are almost certainly some boundary-value problems in
    writing, and probably in seeking.

    It only writes short-format files at the moment (no more than 8
    contiguous pieces.)  This is OK if the disk you are writing to is 
    initially empty.
