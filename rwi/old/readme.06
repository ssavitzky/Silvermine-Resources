README for RWi  Version 0.06  89 Sep 27

    See RELEASE.NOT for the complete set of notes.

MAJOR ADDITIONS & CHANGES:

    This is a partial release; just the things I've changed since
    the last one.  Be sure to keep your changes to DISK.C, etc. until
    we figure out how to do things right.

    With any luck, we can now read HD disks on AT's.  (Of course, I
    said that last time!)

    Media type in the Drive menu will either go away or get changed
    to something more useful (in the next release).  The Drives menu
    is changed but the Media Type menu isn't yet.


KNOWN BUGS:

    Files bigger than 64K aren't viewed correctly.  Read, and hence
    copy, does work.  I'm in the process of fixing this; the code (in
    Viewer.c) is presently commented out.  (Uncomment the #define at
    the front of viewer.h to try it.  It won't work for iRMX files.)

    Doesn't write iRMX disks.
