README for RWi  Version 0.20  90 Jan 15

    See RELEASE.NOT for the complete set of notes.

MAJOR ADDITIONS & CHANGES:

    This is version 0.20, but you might decide to re-label it 1.00
    It appears to be all present and working.

    Attempts to reformat a short file into a long one if it runs out
    of extents.  Superficially tested and appears to work.

    Several bugs in the write code have been fixed.

    The manual is in progress.


KNOWN BUGS:

    Viewing a binary file in ascii mode may be very slow.  The basic
    problem is that it doesn't know how to handle very long lines.
