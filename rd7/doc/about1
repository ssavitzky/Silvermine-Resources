             About Silvermine Resources and rd7


Dr. Abraham Savitzky, President and Director of Software Development,
formed Silvermine Resources following his retirement from The
Perkin-Elmer Corporation.  He was a pioneer in the use of computers in
analytical chemistry(1).  At Perkin-Elmer he had been responsible for
the development of all the spectroscopy data handling products from
the earliest time sharing software, through the Interdata 6/16
minicomputer, through the 3500/3600 Data Station CDS software, and
finally the CDS III software for the 7000 series Data Station.  He
wrote the data transfer modules for transfer of 3500/3600 data to
CDS III.  He was Perkin-Elmer's representative on the JCAMP committee
which developed the Data Exchange Specifications(2).  As a consultant
to Perkin-Elmer he wrote the current CDS III JCAMP conversion routines
TODX and FRDX.  rd7 was written to answer his personal needs for
access to 7000 files on Personal Computers.

Coauthor Stephen R. Savitzky, who studied at the Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory of Stanford University, has had extensive
experience writing microcomputer software.  He is the author of
"Real-Time Microprocessor Systems" Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York
(1985). <<M O R E>>
