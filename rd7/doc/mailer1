NOW with

      rd7 , you can:

Copy Perkin-Elmer 7000 idris data to DOS using your PC
	Easily
	Quickly
	Conveniently
    Without tying up your instrument computer!

	The two versions of rd7, Version AB for ascii/binary data
and Version SP for ascii/binary and spectral data, are powerful,
easy to use PC/MS-DOS utilities which allow an IBM PC or compatible
clone to directly read and transfer data from 5 1/4 inch floppy
disks written by Perkin-Elmer's 7000 series Professional Data
Stations under the Idris operating system.  The utilities display
the directories on the 7000 disk in tree form and, in an adjacent
window, the contents of each individual directory or subdirectory
as it is selected in the directory window.  Individual files can be
viewed in either ascii or binary prior to transfer.  Files can be
transferred individually or files and/or directories can be "tagged"
and then, with as single keystroke, written to any DOS disk or
selected directory for further processing by programs such as
spreadsheets or data bases.

	In addition, Version SP of the utilities recognizes spectral
data in Perkin-Elmer's .SP file format.  Viewing one of these files
produces a graphical display of the spectrum and a status report
similar to that produced by the Perkin-Elmer STATUS command.  Spectrum 
files can be copied directly, transferred in JCAMP-DX format, or 
converted to Perkin-Elmer's new Data Manager format for DOS based 
computers.

	Lotus-like menu structure and extensive on line context-
sensitive help make the utilities particularly easy to use. The user
can also display and examine DOS directories and files to determine
where best to transfer files.  DOS files can also be viewed and copied
between disks or directories.

	The utilities are especially useful for examination and
transfer of data without involving the Perkin-Elmer computer which,
in most laboratories, tends to be busy with instrument oriented tasks.
