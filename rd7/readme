README for RD7  Version 1.01  89 Mar 20

    See RELEASE.NOT for the complete set of notes.

MAJOR ADDITIONS & CHANGES:

    Fix segment wrap bug on ascii and binary copy.

(1.00)
    Pre-allocate buffer for file.  If a file is bigger than the
    buffer (120K) only the first buffer-full can be viewed.

    Larger files can be copied as ascii or binary, but not converted.
    NOTE:  the code that does this hasn't been tested--I don't have a
           7000 disk with a huge file on it.  Try it!

MODULES CHANGED IN AS

    Made sure versions were up to date.


MODULES CHANGED IN LIB

    None

MODULES CHANGED IN DOC

    None


KNOWN HOLES:

    There's still no checking for which kind of disk is loaded 
    (which DOESN'T cause a hardware OR DOS error!).

    Query user about overwriting files(?)
