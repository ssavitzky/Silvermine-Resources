Steve:

	Finally set up my bpackages, so now can get wrap in a doc or
txt file!

	The new Data Manager files set up an exact numer of lines
since some stupid programmer didn't provde the flexibility that was
built into the spec.  Will investigate further, but this will do for
now.

	The new graphsp routine MAY fix the fact that I get no text
in VGA mode. Can only test by going into PE.

	Couldn't remember if you had the JCAMP changed files so
included them anyway.

	To ensure that I'm up to date, can you send me complete
c files from AS directory and PEDM directory.

	I tried make in AS directory, but got "command not found" for
rm and lib. Please send.

	Look over license1 and return with any changes and
suggestions, and then I'll send to lawyer.

			Love to all
