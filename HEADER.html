<p> <a href="./">This subtree</a> contains a set of programs I wrote with my
    father for his now-defunct consulting business, Silvermine Research Inc.,
    about a decade ago.  Ignore the copyright notices and the near-useless
    copy protection; as the successor-in-interest I'm placing them under the
    GPL and will probably get around to updating the sources eventually.  The
    various programs run under MS-DOS, and provide a simple
    <code>mc</code>-like interface for transferring and converting files
    written by a variety of different Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometers and
    other devices.  <code><a href="ht/" >ht/</a></code> was a quick stab at a
    filesystem-based hypertext browser written several years before HTML was
    invented.
