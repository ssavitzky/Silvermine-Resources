                        Thermal data on your PC

	It's easy with rd7 Version AB plus PCTHERM.  rd7AB is a general
purpose utility for the PC which allows you to read and examine the
data on Perkin-Elmer 7000 series floppy disks and transfer the data
directly to PC hard disks or floppies.

	ASCII data such as reports are directly readable after transfer. 
But thermal files are in binary form after transfer - unreadable by any
PC programs.  PCTHERM reads the binary data, graphs it, and
optionally converts it into ASCII tables easily read by any PC programs.
The data header is in JCAMP-DX format, while the data itself is output
as X,Y data columns.  For direct entry into a spreadsheet or similar
program you can elect to output only the X and Y data columns.

To run the PCTHERM program we recommend the following:

	1. Make a new directory on your hard disk
            For example: PCTHERM.
	2. Place PCTHERM.EXE in that directory
	3. Make a subdirectory called PC
	4. Transfer your thermal files to the PCTHERM directory using     
             rd7 BINARY transfer.
	5. Execute PCTHERM as described below.
	6. The converted files will be written to the subdirectory       
             \PCTHERM\PC with the same name as the input file.

	PCTHERM normally places a JCAMP-DX style header at the beginning
of the data and adds a trailer line following the data containing the
characters ##END=.   Options allow the elimination of either the
header or the trailer or both.  You can set the options at each
command, or permanently using the DOS SET command.   Syntax is as
follows:
	          PCTHERM -h -e filename

	The flags can be in any order or omitted.  -h will remove the
header information, -e will remove the ##END= line.

	Alternatively, you can use SET PCTHERM=-h -e, and the options
will be in effect every time you call PCTHERM.  (Be sure there is no
space between M and =). 

	Thus, you can have SET PCTHERM=-e in your AUTOEXEC file and
run: PCTHERM -h filename.  The effect will be to have no header
and trailer.   To remove the SET information just enter: SET PCTHERM=

	You can inspect your setting at any time by just entering SET.

	There are two other flags. -d suppresses all file output, -g
suppresses graphical display of data and writes the file immediately.

	If you elect to display graphical data, you may suppress file
output by entering q or n at the prompt "Press any key..."
